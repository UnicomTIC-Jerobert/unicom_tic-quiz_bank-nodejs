* Tech stacks [html,css,javascript,node.js]
* Teaches you file handling concepts (handling .json file)
* complex logics


* document contain everything needed for the project
* document is there but there are some bugs , so we will fix those as we progress

problem:
here im going to introduce number of attempts to answer question correctly

solution:
* in UI we have to introduce "Atempt : 0" like thing
* we need to look in the code where user goes for wrong answer
* we shall introduce [attemptCounter] variable
	- but only counter is enough ???
	- it should associate with question & with categories
* finally quiz done a table should shown the question number with number of attempts
